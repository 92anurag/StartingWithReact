--Starting with React--

This is the initial project for setting up
React on Cloud 9.

Use this repo's URL when stepping thru the
C9 Workspace Wizard so this project is cloned
into your Section 1 workspace.

This project's package.json includes all libraries
and resources for getting a React project running.

After your workspace is created, go to a 
terminal and change into the "demo-1" directory.  
Then run
$ npm install 
at the command line to download and configure
all of the resources and initialize your
new React project.

After npm install has completed, 
from the terminal (in the demo-1 directory) you can 
run the project with the command:
$ npm run dev

When the compilation completes, open a browser by clicking
the "Preview" button in the IDE's toolbar, select
"Preview Running Application" to view the app's
initial view.
